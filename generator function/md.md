# Key Points to Remember
- **`function*`** defines a generator function.
- **`yield`** pauses the execution and returns a value to the caller.
- **`next()`** is used to resume the generator function from where it was paused.
- The generator function can return a final value using the **`return`** statement, and after that, the generator is considered **done**.

# Benefits of Generators
- **State Persistence**: Generators can maintain the state of their execution between calls.
- **Asynchronous Code Management**: Generators simplify handling asynchronous code (e.g., using `yield` with Promises).
- **Memory Efficiency**: Generators are lazy â€” they only compute values when required, which is ideal for generating sequences or dealing with large datasets.

# Use Cases for Generators
- **Handling infinite data streams** (e.g., generating Fibonacci numbers).
- **Stateful Iterators** (e.g., iterating over complex data structures or objects).
- **Asynchronous Programming** (e.g., simplifying code by handling asynchronous calls in a synchronous style).
