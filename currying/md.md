# Benefits of Currying
- **Code Reusability**: You can reuse curried functions with different arguments and create specialized versions of a function.
- **Partial Application**: Currying allows partial application of a function, making it easier to create more specific functions from a general one.
- **Functional Programming**: Currying is a core concept in functional programming, allowing for more declarative code and easier handling of asynchronous tasks.

# When to Use Currying
- **Modular Code**: If you need a flexible function where you apply a set of operations in a predictable manner but with different parameters.
- **Reusable Functions**: Currying is especially useful when you want to reuse the same operation with some fixed parameters (e.g., `multiplyBy2`, `multiplyBy3`).
- **Functional Programming Patterns**: In scenarios where you need to work with higher-order functions and avoid side effects, currying fits well with functional programming paradigms.
